Usage:
  dgraph alpha [flags]

Flags:
      --abort_older_than string        Abort any pending transactions older than this duration. The liveness of a transaction is determined by its last mutation. (default "5m")

      --acl_access_ttl duration        The TTL for the access jwt. Enterprise feature. (default 6h0m0s)
      --acl_cache_ttl duration         The interval to refresh the acl cache. Enterprise feature. (default 30s)
      --acl_refresh_ttl duration       The TTL for the refresh jwt. Enterprise feature. (default 720h0m0s)
      --acl_secret_file string         The file that stores the HMAC secret, which is used for signing the JWT and should have at least 32 ASCII characters. Enterprise feature.
      --auth_token string              If set, all Alter requests to Dgraph would need to have this token. The token can be passed as follows: For HTTP requests, in X-Dgraph-AuthToken header. For Grpc, in auth-token key in the context.
      
      --badger.compression_level int   The compression level for Badger. A higher value uses more resources. (default 3)
      --badger.tables string           [ram, mmap, disk] Specifies how Badger LSM tree is stored. Option sequence consume most to least RAM while providing best to worst read performance respectively. (default "mmap")
      --badger.vlog string             [mmap, disk] Specifies how Badger Value log is stored. mmap consumes more RAM, but provides better performance. (default "mmap")
      
      --custom_tokenizers string       Comma separated list of tokenizer plugins
      --datadog.collector string       Send opencensus traces to Datadog. As of now, the trace exporter does not support annotation logs and would discard them.

      --encryption_key_file string     The file that stores the encryption key. The key size must be 16, 24, or 32 bytes long. The key size determines the corresponding block size for AES encryption (AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 respectively). Enterprise feature.
      --export string                  Folder in which to store exports. (default "export")
      --graphql_introspection          Set to false for no GraphQL schema introspection (default true)

      --idx uint                       Optional Raft ID that this Dgraph Alpha will use to join RAFT groups.
      
      --jaeger.collector string        Send opencensus traces to Jaeger.
  -l, --lru_mb float                   Estimated memory the LRU cache can take. Actual usage by the process would be more than specified here. (default -1)
      
      --ludicrous_mode                 Run alpha in ludicrous mode
      --max_retries int                Commits to disk will give up after these number of retries to prevent locking the worker in a failed state. Use -1 to retry infinitely. (default -1)
      --mutations string               Set mutation mode to allow, disallow, or strict. (default "allow")
      
      --my string                      IP_ADDRESS:PORT of this Dgraph Alpha, so other Dgraph Alphas can talk to this.
      
      --normalize_node_limit uint      Limit for the maximum number of nodes that can be returned in a query that uses the normalize directive. (default 10000)
      --pending_proposals int          Number of pending mutation proposals. Useful for rate limiting. (default 256)
  -o, --port_offset int                Value added to all listening port numbers. [Internal=7080, HTTP=8080, Grpc=9080]

      --snapshot_after int             Create a new Raft snapshot after this many number of Raft entries. The lower this number, the more frequent snapshot creation would be. Also determines how often Rollups would happen. (default 10000)
      --telemetry                      Send anonymous telemetry data to Dgraph devs. (default true)

      --block_rate int                   Block profiling rate. Must be used along with block profile_mode
      --config string                    Configuration file. Takes precedence over default values, but is overridden to values set with environment variables and flags.
